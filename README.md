# 🟡 Gold Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict gold prices based on financial indicators. It includes data preprocessing, model training (Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost), feature importance analysis, and visualization — all wrapped in an interactive **Streamlit web app**.
